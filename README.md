Extract the original Scratch project from HTML or zip files generated by the TurboWarp Packager, the forkphorus packager, or HTMLifier.

The unpackager is developed as a simple static website. There is no build step. index.html is the website and unpackager.js is the core unpackaging logic. Library dependencies are manually vendored in the dependencies folder.
